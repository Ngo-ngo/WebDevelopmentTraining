    <p>Hi, everyone, my name is Ngozi, and I'm learning frontend web development using the MDN online training materials. I desire to become competent and grow faster in my web development journey</p>
    <p>Mozilla said they are a global community of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Technologists</li>
      <li>Thinkers</li>
      <li>Builders</li>
    </ul>
    <p>working together to keep the internet alive and accessible, so people worldwide can be informed contributors and creators of the web. 
      They believe this act of human collaboration across an open platform is essential to individual growth and our collective future.</p>
    <p>I would like to become a technologist, thinker, and builder; and deploy the knowledge and experience I would be gaining to building products that are scalable, fun, and easy to use.</p>
    
    <p>List of things I've learnt so far:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Basic HTML, CSS, and JS</li>
      <li>Different client-side and server-side web technologies</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>Advanced HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript</li>
      <li>Git and Github</li>
      <li>Read through and understand the API documentation of JavaScript</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>In case you randomly come across this little beginiing, I would like to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Be challenged with entry-level projects that will help me improve fast</li>
      <li>Be pointed to other web development projects where I can learn by immersion</li>
      <li>Be guided on things that truly matter when learning web development</li>
      <li>Become part of an amazing web development community where I can build confidence and communication skills</li>
